# Client_Server_Chat_App
A simple application using Python sockets to send messages to other clients who join the server.
Download the Chat_Server and Chat_Client
Make sure to have at least Python 3 (I have only used Python 3.8 and 9 when testing)
You should be able to double click on the file and it will run, if not you can run it in an IDE or from the command line
Run the Chat_Server first then Chat_Client
The IP for the server is printed by the server code
